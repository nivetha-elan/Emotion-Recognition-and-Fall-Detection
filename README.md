Emotion Recognition and Fall Detection System for Elderly People

Project Overview

This Python-based project aims to create a real-time monitoring system for elderly individuals, focusing on two critical aspects: emotion recognition and fall detection. The system utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze video feeds and provide timely alerts in case of emotional distress or potential falls.

Introduction

As the global population ages, there is an increasing need for technologies that can enhance the safety and well-being of elderly individuals. This project addresses this need by combining emotion recognition and fall detection into a single, integrated system. The real-time monitoring aspect ensures that potential issues are identified promptly, allowing for quick response and assistance.

Features

- Emotion recognition using computer vision and machine learning.
- Fall detection through video analysis.
- Real-time monitoring for immediate response.
- User-friendly interface for configuration and monitoring.

Requirements

- Python 3. x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- sci-kit-learn
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-fall-detection.git
   cd emotion-fall-detection
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

Usage

1. Configure the system by modifying settings in the `config.yml` file.
2. Run the main application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

Emotion Recognition

The emotion recognition module uses a pre-trained deep learning model to analyze facial expressions in real-time. Detected emotions are logged and can trigger alerts if predefined distress conditions are met.

Fall Detection

The fall detection module employs computer vision techniques to identify potential falls based on body movement and orientation. In the event of a fall, an alert is generated, and relevant information is logged.

Real-time Monitoring

The real-time monitoring component continuously processes video feeds, analyzes emotions, and monitors for falls. It provides a user-friendly interface for live monitoring and configuring system parameters.
